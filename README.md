This project revolves around a database with three key tables: reviews, calendar, and listings. Each table encapsulates distinct properties, providing a rich dataset for real estate analysis. Notably, location details are found in the listings table, reviews in the reviews table, and date-related information in the calendar table.

# Data Integration and Inner Join
The analysis commenced with a focus on the listings table. Utilizing an inner join, I seamlessly merged data from the calendar and reviews tables to enhance the dataset.

# Visualizations
1. Price per Zip Code
The primary visualization involved examining the relationship between zip codes and prices. I organized the data with zip codes along the columns and prices along the rows. This insightful arrangement facilitated the identification of areas with higher property prices.

2. Geographic Mapping
The second visualization utilized geographic mapping, with zipCode and price as key parameters. Different colors were assigned to geographical areas to visually distinguish regions based on property prices. This map provides an intuitive overview of pricing variations across different locations.

3. Optimal Listing Timing
For the third visualization, I delved into the calendar table to identify the best time to list properties. The date column was plotted along the X-axis, while property prices formed the Y-axis. This visualization aids in pinpointing periods when property prices are most favorable for listing.

4. Price per Bedroom Analysis
In the fourth visualization, I explored the relationship between property prices and the number of bedrooms. The bedroom field was arranged along the columns, and prices formed the rows. This visualization offers insights into how the number of bedrooms impacts property pricing.

# Conclusion
By combining information from the listings, calendar, and reviews tables, these visualizations aim to provide valuable insights for real estate decision-making. The analysis covers geographic pricing patterns, optimal listing timings, and the influence of bedroom count on property prices.
